How to update HPy
=================

* Optional: start from a clean pypy repo, running `hg purge`
* Get a clean checkout of the appropriate version in the hpy repo
* Run `python setup.py dist_info` there (under Python 3.*)
* Run update_vendored.sh. If some patches don't apply, copy them somewhere,
  delete them and try again. Then recreate the patches manually :-(
* Commit: don't forget to `hg add` the new files and `hg rm --after` any that was
  deleted.
* Run `make autogen` in the hpy repo.
* Manually copy the context declaration from hpy/tools/autogen/autogen_pypy.txt
  to pypy/module/_hpy_universal/llapi.py
* Fix failing own tests and translation, if needed.
* Implement the new features, manually updating the own tests as you go.
